Neon Stopwatch â€” A Futuristic Timer Interface

Neon Stopwatch is a stylish and functional web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that emulates a digital stopwatch in a cyberpunk-inspired theme. Designed with a sleek, glowing aesthetic using neon blues, greens, and purples, the UI replicates the feel of a futuristic command console. The stopwatch features Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap functionalities, with dynamic updates that switch the Start button to Resume after it's first used. Laps are tracked and displayed with animated transitions, and the entire interface uses a monospaced, digital-style font for an immersive visual experience. Ideal for portfolios, this project showcases proficiency in DOM manipulation, state handling, and creative frontend design.
